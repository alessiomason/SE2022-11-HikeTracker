# SE2022-11-HikeTracker

This repository contains the main project developed (by group 11) throughout the Software Engineering II course @ Politecnico di Torino. It consists of a web application to browse hikes and huts and to track personal hikes.

[üåê Qui in italiano](README_it.md)

## Features
- Browse hikes, huts and parkings using a series of filters
- See an hike condition and weather reports for the area
- Track an ongoing hike and mark reached reference points
- Visualize general performance statistics, summarizing all registered hikes
- As a local guide or a hut worker, manage hikes and huts information
- As a manager of the system, approve local guides and hut workers

## Technology

The application is developed in JavaScript and uses a two-server architecture: it uses Express as a framework for the backend and React for the frontend.
